# Predicting the diagnosis of patients with adenocarcinoma based on gene expression analysis
This project is a study of ways to predict gene expression and patient diagnoses based on gene expression of people with adenocarcinoma. Different approaches to working with the dataset and different models for predicting expression and diagnoses have been proposed.
